Javascript takes in the user's search result and uses it to make 3 API calls to openweatherAPI in order to return the 5 day forcast, current weather, and UV index respectively. This data is then used to generate HTML for the user to see. Each successful search will be saved to localstorage so that it can remain in the user's search history for quick access.
